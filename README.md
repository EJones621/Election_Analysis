Module 3: Python
## Overview of Election Audit
During this module, the Colorado Board of Elections requested an audit of a recent local congressional election that took place in Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson counties. In this analysis they have requested calculations for:
1. Total number of votes casted
2. Total number of votes cast in each county & percent of the total vote count
3. The county with the highest voter turnout
4. Total number of votes casted by each candidate & percent of the total vote count
5. And finally, the winner of the election
